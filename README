Ruby fixed-width file handling for the masses.


A simple example for writing fixed-width content to a text file:

layout = FixedWidth::Layout.new [
  FixedWidth::Column.new( :first_name, 20 ),
  FixedWidth::Column.new( :last_name, 30 ),
  FixedWidth::Column.new( :email, 40 )
]

file = File.new('out.txt', 'w')
writer = FixedWidth::Writer.new( file, layout )
writer.write(
	:first_name => 'Leon',
	:last_name => 'Nereg',
	:email => 'nnereg@gmail.com'
)
file.close()


Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
